<h1>Blog App</h1>

<p>This was a class project, and my first Ruby on Rails app. Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mini Blog app</li>
  <li>You can view all posts</li>
  <li>You can create a new post</li>
  <li>You can edit an existing post</li>
  <li>You can delete a post</li>
  <li>Navbar that appears on every page</li>
</ul>


<p>Disclaimer: I haven't added any style to this yet. </p>
